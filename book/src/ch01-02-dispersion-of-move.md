# The Dispersion of Move

This lesson will walk you through on the history and expansion of Move, a key smart contract language developed originally for the Diem project by Facebook, but now used across various blockchains.

## The Origin: Facebook's Dream

Move was initially part of Facebook's ambitious project Libra, later renamed as Diem. It was developed to overcome the limitations of existing blockchain languages, especially in terms of security and digital asset management. Their intention was to create a globally accessible and efficient payment system.

## The Journey Beyond Diem

Although Diem faced regulatory approval obstacles, the innovative capabilities of Move managed to capture the broader interest of the blockchain community. The principles and potential of Move were too significant to be restricted to just a single project.

## The Dissemination: Aptos, Sui, and Further

Among the first to adopt Move for their platforms were Aptos and Sui, both initiated by ex-members of the Diem team.

**Aptos**: Aptos focused on refining Move to improve security features and asset handling capabilities, aiming for a user-friendly blockchain ecosystem.

**Sui**: Sui, targeting scalability and customizability, modified Move to support a new consensus mechanism and state management system, boosting speed and flexibility.

**Other Initiatives**: Platforms like Starcoin, 0L, and Celo have employed Move for their smart contracts. Other platforms like Solana are examining its integration.

Now **Movement** is working on interoperability of Move-EVM, among other innovations.

## The Legacy: The Growing Ecosystem of Move

Present times sees Move not just as a programming language, but as an integral part of a growing ecosystem that extends across various blockchains. By addressing the sophisticated needs of digital asset management, Move has set a new standard in blockchain development, emphasizing safety, flexibility, and scalability.

## Conclusion

The spread of Move from Diem to platforms like Aptos and Sui highlights the robust design of the language and the innovation drive of the blockchain community. The journey of Move, from a Facebook initiative to a cornerstone of blockchain technology, showcases how good ideas can surpass their origins and adapt to wider applications.
