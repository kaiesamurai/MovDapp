# Custom types and generics

Remember in the first chapter, where you learned about linear types as a safety feature of Move?

In this chapter you'll dig into how those types work to give Move developers Superpowers.

Through real-world examples, you'll develop a solid foundation in programming with custom types and generics:

- [Getter and Setter Functions](ch05-02-getter-functions.md)
- [Generics Introduction](ch05-03-generics-intro.md)
- [Generics to Constrain Abilities](ch05-04-generics-abilities.md)
- [Generics with Multiple Type Parameters](ch05-05-generics-with-multiple-types.md)
